# Main

## W. Jake Thompson {#title}

I have made [visualizations viewed by hundreds of thousands of people](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/26/us/college-student-migration.html), [sped up query times for 25 terabytes of data by an average of 4,800 times](https://livefreeordichotomize.com/2019/06/04/using_awk_and_r_to_parse_25tb/), and built [packages for R](https://github.com/nstrayer/shinysense) that let you [do magic](http://nickstrayer.me/dataDayTexas/).

Currently searching for a data science position that allows me to build tools using visualization and machine learning to help people explore and understand their data.
